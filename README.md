This program implements a two-way network chat using JavaFX. It opens a window that can be used for a two-way network chat. The
 window can "listen" for a connection request on a port that is specified by the user. It can also request a connection to another ChatApp
 window on a specified computer and port. The window has an input box where the user can enter messages to be sent over the
 connection. A connection can be closed by clicking a button in the window or by closing the window.
